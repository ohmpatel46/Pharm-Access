TODO: Build supply chain graph edges.

This script will:
1. Identify distribution centers (DCs) for major pharmacy chains
2. Compute DC → pharmacy supply edges
3. Compute pharmacy → pharmacy nearest neighbor graph
4. Export supply_edges.geojson and pharmacy_graph_edges.geojson

Placeholder for future implementation.
